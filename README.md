# Hey, I'm [Ayush](https://twitter.com/ayushn21) ðŸ‘‹

I'm a freelance web developer based in London, UK. I like boring tech like Ruby on Rails and the [Hotwire](https://hotwire.dev) approach to building websites.

I built and maintain a SaaS blogging platform called [Chapter24](https://chapter24.app). I'm also on the core team of the [Bridgetown](https://bridgetownrb.com) project.

My experience and portfolio is available on [my website](https://radioactivetoy.tech). I spout my opinions regularly on [my blog](https://binarysolo.chapter24.blog).

I'm available for contract work and consulting in Ruby, Rails, static HTML websites and pretty much anything Web related. [Drop me a line](mailto:ayush@radioactivetoy.tech) and let's chat!
